# Xpandables.Net
Provides with useful interfaces contracts in **.Net 5.0** and some implementations mostly following the spirit of SOLID principles, CQRS...
The library is strongly-typed, which means it should be hard to make invalid requests and it also makes it easy to discover available methods and properties though IntelliSense.

Feel free to fork this project, make your own changes and create a pull request.
